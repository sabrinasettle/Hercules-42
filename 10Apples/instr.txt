Create a way to access your virtual machine without a password
if using a password you fail and if you turn somehting very wrong you fail


ssh and RSA to connect to your virtual machine without a password

ssh keys


SSH_USR=$1 //root
SSH_IPADDR=$2 //cbagdon.me

generate the ssh key and upload it to server

if able to login with admin, you reset the password or continue to break into the server

doing a break by using all possible pass keys would take to long, so the best way is to try and
would be to go in and change settings or to change permissions for your user account
