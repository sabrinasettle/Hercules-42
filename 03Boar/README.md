# Hercules 03: Erymanthian Boar

**Goals**
We all know Crontabs but hopefully we won't have to catch that ugly beast repeatedly and once will be enough.
So the goal of this project is to schedule a one time task at a precise date and time.

**Mandatory Part**
Write a small shell script that when you run it will execute it's code on the upcoming 21st of December at 8:42am.
The content can be anything you want.

**Commands to Run**

sh 12_21_8:42.sh
