# Hercules 06: Cretan Bull

**Goals**
For this labour you have to create a champion that will enter the Corewar arena and be worthy of it!

**Mandatory Part**
You are going to have to create a champion and train them!
It has to stay "live", have more instructions then just the "live" one, having functions is also mandorty (we are coders after all, damn it!) and finally it has to be able to beat the easiest pawns (Zork).

**Commands to Run**
You need the corewar file and within that run the command
	chmod 777 asm / corewar

To compile the .s file into .cor file
	./asm ../<yourfolder>/<yourfile>.s

To fight
	./corewar -n ressources/zork.cor ../<yourfolder>/<yourfile>.cor

	and press the space bar to start the fight in the arena
