# Hercules 06: Cretan Bull

**Goals**
For this labour will release a dangerous pack of Mares, then steal them for King Eurystheus.

**Mandatory Part**
Create a script that runs the included binary called manager and then stops the horses. Be creative and try to find as many ways to stop the differnet steeds as you can. Recreate your own manager (stealing the ideas and adding your own) for King Eurystheus to finish the labour.

Make sure you understand the commands you are using! (We are coders after all, damn it!)

Finally, be sure to include the source code for your manager. (Don't be like Diomendes)

**Commands to Run**

sh mangermanager.sh
