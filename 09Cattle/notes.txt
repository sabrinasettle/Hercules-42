Siege is an http load testing and benchmarking utility.
It was designed to let web developers measure their code under duress,
to see how it will stand up to load on the internet.
Siege supports basic authentication, cookies, HTTP, HTTPS and FTP protocols.
It lets its user hit a server with a configurable number of simulated clients.
Those clients place the server â€œunder siege.


benchmarking is a process for obtaining a measure. benchmarks are the 'what' and benchmarking is the 'how'.
Benchmarks are designed to mimic a particular type of workload on a component or system
